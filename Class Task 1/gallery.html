            <strong>Clint Jammer: </strong> I paint as a visual expression of my
            passion and appreciation for wildlife and nature. I believe we are
            all stewards of nature. My goal is to help protect and preserve our
            natural environment by painting images of its unique creatures and
            untouched landscapes so that when viewed, they not only tell a
            story, but also elicit a feeling.

            <strong>Pablo Picasso: </strong> As a malefic figure who changed
            the contours of modern art, the name of Pablo Picasso is cloaked in
            layers of intrigue, brilliance, and verve. Commencing his journey in
            sunny Spain, Picasso's artistic odyssey saw the dovetailing of
            various influences and stages, resulting in an art style that
            remains unmatched in its originality and dynamism.
